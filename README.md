This repository contains my project for Data Representation & Querying 2020. It creates a database in SQL using the python file create_table contained within the project folder. The testsanta_presentsDAO can then be run  to populate the table and finally the rest_server file is then run to activate the server at which point a web interface can be used to view, create, update and delete additional items to the list by going to http://127.0.0.1:5000/index.html. Any errors generated should show up in thee console.log. In the code there is also curl commands that can be used in a seperate command line interface while the server is running to fetch the required data.
