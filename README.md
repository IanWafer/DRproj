This repository contains my project for Data Representation & Querying 2020. It creates a database in SQL using the python file create_table contained within the project folder. The rest_server file is then run to activate the server at which point a web interface can be used to view, create, update and delete additional items to the list. Any errors generated should show up in thee console.log.
